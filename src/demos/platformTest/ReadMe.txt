This is a demo to test the tile drawing and platformer physics.
There are still a few minor bugs that will need to be addressed - but please feel free to tweet me any issues you encounter with it @fidgetwidget

The demo starts in a paused state to allow you to draw tiles for the player to collide with before he starts falling.

Pressing P will toggle the games paused state, and allow you to run and jump as the player.

Click to place tiles in the world.
Holding SPACE will allow you to click and drag to move the camera.

Move the Player with WASD or the ARROW keys. W or UP will jump, as will pressing SPACE.
Press S or DOWN to crouch.
Hold SHIFT to run.

The player will grab onto ledges, and is also able to wall jump.
Jumping when holding onto a ledge will cause the player to jump straight up, where as jumping while sliding on a wall will cause the player to 
 jump away from the wall.
 
I will add the ability to remove tiles, and even change the tile type you are placing in the future.
This will include slopes, and possibly tiles that cause some other sorts of physics type actions (eg. bounce pads).
