This is a demo to test drawing of shapes as entities, basic camera functionality (move and shake) and uses a quad tree for entity spacial indexing.

You can click and drag the scene to move the camera.
Pressing 1 will display the bounding boxes for all the shapes
Pressing 2 will display the scenes quad tree bounds currently in use.
Pressing P will trigger a camera shape.

I plan to update this demo to include layers and paralax effects for the camera movement in the future.
